This file documents every potential Archipelago item location.
It lists various potential categories, regardless of whether they're in 
active development or are rejected concepts.
Characters: Recruitable characters.
Villages: Items found in villages.
Chests: Items found in chests.
Drops: Items enemies drop.
Stealables: Items enemies hold that do not drop. 
Received: Items received in cutscenes.
Talks: Talk conversations available mid-map.
Houses: Visiting houses that don't provide items.
Clear: The check for finishing a chapter.
Check*: Only give one check for visiting Lute's village and recruiting her, etc.

As of FE8 AP v0.3.1, only chapter clears and holy weapons are randomised.
Randomising villages and chests are the next priority.

Note the offsets given are the starts of FEBuilder's condensed event codes.
FEBuilder's "give item [0x76 Red Gem] to active unit" is equal to
SVAL 0x3 RedGem; GIVEITEMTO 0xFFFF.
The offset given is the start of the SVAL.
